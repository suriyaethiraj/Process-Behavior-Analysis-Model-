# Process-Behavior-Analysis-Model-
Process Behavior Analysis in ServiceNow Incident ticket management monitors and analyzes ticket trends to identify patterns and anomalies. By calculating statistical limits and averages, PBA helps understand natural variations in ticket volumes, enabling better decision-making and proactive incident resolution management.
This Python script processes incident data from an Excel file to generate a summary table with various statistical metrics. It starts by loading the data into a pandas DataFrame and sorting it by the 'Created' column. The script then extracts the date and week number from the 'Created' column. A pivot table is created to count the number of incidents per week. The script calculates the average number of incidents per week and adds this as a new column. It also computes the moving range of incident counts between consecutive weeks and averages this value. Using these averages, the script calculates the upper and lower natural process limits (UNPL and LNPL) with a factor of 2.66, and the moving range natural process limit (mRange_NPL) with a factor of 3.27. These values are rounded to two decimal places and added to the table. Finally, the week numbers are prefixed with 'Week ' for clarity, and the index is reset. The resulting pivot table provides a comprehensive summary of weekly incident counts, averages, and statistical limits, useful for monitoring and analyzing trends over time.
